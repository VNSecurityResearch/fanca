NOTE: This fuzzer is intended to be cross-platform, but since it's still in it baby state, you should not expect it much, I've just used some dirty patches in 
some source code of python27, PyDgbEng, ... e.g. Hard coded (magic constanting it) the Windbg path of in the PyDbgEng module ...

1. Requirements
- Windows 7 32-bit

2. Install instrucstions
2.1. Windows 7 32-bit
- copy folder fanca/docs/runtimes/WinDDk to your C:\\ drive
- copy fanca/docs/runtimes/Python27 to your favourite destinatio (often C:\\)
- add python to your PATH
- add fanca/ to your PythonPath, 
e.g. mine is: C:\Windows\system32\python27.zip; C:\Python27\DLLs; C:\Python27\lib; C:\Python27\lib\plat-win; C:\Python27\lib\lib-tk; C:\Python27;
C:\Python27\lib\site-packages; C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\win32; C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\win32\lib; C:\Python27\;C:\fanca

All is done?:
- run notepad.bat for testing for fuzzing notepad.exe
- run dividebyzero.bat for testing for fuzzing dividebyzero.exe
