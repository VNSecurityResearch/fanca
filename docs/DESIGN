1. Overview
- Overall design of this fuzzer is based on components required by a fuzzer (see top level README.md)
- Each component is called engine
- Each engine is nothing, but a wrapper for specific engine type of component
- Each engine communicates with each others through jsonsocket, and is expected to be not dependent on other engine
- All engines are managed by ManagementEngine
- ManagemengEngine takes configOptions from config file

2. A brieft look
Current engines are:
	- fanca\Fanca\core\managements\managementEngine.py
	- fanca\Fanca\core\executors\generatorEngine.py
	- fanca\Fanca\core\executors\executorEngine.py
	- fanca\Fanca\core\loggers\loggerEngine.py
